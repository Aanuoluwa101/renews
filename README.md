# renews - News Summarization Tool with ChatGPT

**renews** is a Python tool that scrapes popular news websites for the latest news articles and then uses the power of ChatGPT to rewrite and summarize these articles. This project aims to provide a convenient way to quickly get summarized news content from various sources using natural language processing.
So far this tool can summarize news from punch.ng, I hope to add more.
